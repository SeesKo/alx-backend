# 0x01. Caching

This project implements various caching algorithms in Python. Each caching algorithm inherits from the `BaseCaching` class and implements the `put` and `get` methods.

## Caching Algorithms

1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
2. LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
3. LRU (Least Recently Used)
4. MRU (Most Recently Used)
5. LFU (Least Frequently Used)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Pycodestyle 2.5
