# 0x00. Pagination

This project demonstrates various pagination techniques for handling large datasets in a REST API context. The primary focus is on:

1. Simple pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters.
2. Pagination with hypermedia metadata (`HATEOAS`).
3. Deletion-resilient pagination.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to paginate a dataset with simple `page` and `page_size` parameters.
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- `Pycodestyle` style (`version 2.5.*`)
- The first line of each file should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All modules and functions should have proper documentation.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
